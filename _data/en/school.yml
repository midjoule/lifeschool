  intro: Life School Riviera is an innovative and revolutionary private school created to make a difference in the lives of children and families. It was born from the desire to reveal every childâ€™s potential, talents and identity, by offering a high quality personalised education, adapted to the pace and needs of the individual. By collaborating with families we accompany each child in their development. The teaching team guides, encourage and value each child to promote the development of their academic, social and interpersonal skills. Through this process, the goal is to give each child the tools they need to discover and face the world confidently. It's also our wish that students relish their time in school and foster an enthusiasm and love for learning.
