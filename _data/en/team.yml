  testimonial: All too often, learning is seen as something constraining by students, but sometimes also by parents, when it comes to homework. Our school aims to redefine learning in a positive way, placing pleasure at the heart of it. Thus, in our teaching, we wish to be as close as possible to the needs of the child and the natural functioning of the brain, in order to make learning motivating, accessible and fulfilling.
