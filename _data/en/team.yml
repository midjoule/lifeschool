  testimonial: All too often, learning is seen as ‘obligatory’ by students, but sometimes also by parents, when it comes time for homework. Our school aims to redefine learning in a positive way, by placing pleasure at the heart of it. Thus, in our teaching, we want to come as close as possible to the needs of the child and the natural functioning of the brain, in order to make learning motivating, accessible and fulfilling.

  testimonial: Sometimes the most powerful way of teaching is when the students are so engrossed in the fun tasks that don’t realise they are learning. Students work and learn best when they feel appreciated, safe and valued for the unique people that they are. That is what this school aims to give them…. in which case… they can't fail!

  testimonial: « Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn », Benjamin Franklin. This is a quote that particularly touches me. I look forward to allowing each student to engage in their learning in a personalised way, using various techniques and projects.
