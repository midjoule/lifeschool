  subtitle: At the child's rhythm
  summary: Program adapted to each child allowing them to constantly progress
  desc: Each child will be accompanied in their individuality and competences, taking into account their strengths and weaknesses, their learning profile, talents and aspirations. Personalised learning allows you to progress at your own pace and move on to something new when skills are learned, without comparing yourself to others. In French, Maths, English and German there will be specific targets for each child according to his level and pace. The child accompanied by a teacher becomes a player in their own learning.

  subtitle: Learning by practicing
  summary: Learn languages ​​in everyday life, in a practical and fun way
  desc: Our country has a great German-speaking influence and it is important for young adults to have a good command of this language. English is essential for university studies, to work in multinational companies and to discover the world. French, Maths, Geography, Science and History will be taught in French. Many practical classes such as physical education, choir, cooking, sewing, and practical workshops will be given in English and German to enable active language practice.

  subtitle: Collaborate with each other
  summary: Foster solidarity and sharing between children
  desc: The mixture of ages allows children to guide one another in their exploration of the world. Children of the same age do not necessarily have the same rhythm, the same maturity and the same interests at the same time. The advantage of multi-age classes is experienced mainly during group lessons. They exchange their experiences and knowledge in a natural and progressive way. They teach each other and naturally place themselves in a learning position without realising it.

  summary: School curriculum using the Romand Study Plan
  desc: The PER will serve as a basis and guide. Time and results should not be stressful for teachers, children or parents.  Our teachers will be encouraged to take time with their students, to consider the personal goals of each child and not to focus on the goals to be achieved for the whole class. We want to place the child at the centre of their learning and not the pedagogy.

The only homework will be to prepare presentations, revise vocabulary or to read books recommended to them or suggested by the student in agreement with the teachers.

  category: Method
  summary: Appraisal of achievements without competition
  desc: We favour a school system based on skills that the student fulfills under the supervision of their teacher. Each child regularly evaluates their understanding of a topic with the teacher. When the child has understood and assimilated knowledge in a subject/topic area, they can move on. The child can learn at their own pace and clearly sees their progress with the teacher. We seek to highlight and praise progression in our students. Achievements, areas to work on and the needs of the children are communicated regularly to parents.

  summary: Regular communication with families
  desc: The school, in collaboration with each family, will establish solid benchmarks and transmit essential and life-giving values.  We want to encourage parents and teachers to establish regular contact so that we can help the child to progress, both academically and socially. We want to encourage a culture of trust, whereby parents recognise that teachers are specialists in their subjects, professionals in their conduct and whose goal is to help their children achieve in a calm and caring environment.
