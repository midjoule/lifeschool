            This second year at Life School Riviera has enabled us to evolve and adapt, and to realize that the vision of our school is not 
            necessarily understood by everyone, sometimes even by the families who have entrusted us with their children.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            For this second year, we opted to open up the secondary section, as two of our pupils were transferring from 8H to 9H, 
            and began the school year with 14 pupils divided between two classes.
            </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Throughout the year, despite many challenges, we pursued our mission to accompany the children entrusted to us, 
            preparing them to become fulfilled, responsible and respectful citizens.
            </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            I'll leave you to discover what our students and the whole school team have experienced during the 2022-2023 school year, 
            in the form of commented illustrations.

            As you will see, we have carried out many activities that
            activities that illustrate our pedagogy. You can also
            also see a picture of a school that encourages everyone to
            to make sense of their learning and which offers a space for
            to experiment and apply their knowledge, while at the same time making
            while making them responsible for their own learning. The
            creativity is at the heart of our programme, encouraging everyone to
            to deepen their learning through personal and group projects.
            Over the months from August 2021 to July 2022, you will be able to see our 15 students develop in their
            learnings.</p>
